## Project Overview

Accurate forecasting of restaurant visitors is essential for effective planning, including inventory management, staff scheduling, and revenue forecasting. This project applies **time series analysis** techniques to analyze and predict restaurant visitor trends using historical data.

### Objectives:
- To explore and analyze the given time series dataset for trends, seasonality, and irregular patterns.
- To preprocess the data to make it suitable for time series forecasting models.
- To implement statistical and machine learning models for accurate predictions of restaurant visitors.
- To evaluate the performance of the models using standard metrics.

## Repository Contents

### 1. **Notebook File**
- **`Recruit_restaurant_visitor_forecasting.ipynb`**: The main notebook containing the following:  
  - Data preprocessing steps.  
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for identifying trends, seasonality, and stationarity.  
  - Implementation of forecasting models, including ARIMA and SARIMA.  
  - Model evaluation and comparison of predictions.

### 2. **Dataset**
- The dataset includes time-indexed information about restaurant visitor counts along with auxiliary features like:  
  - **Dates** of observations.  
  - **Visitor counts** as the target variable.  
  - **Additional features** such as holidays, promotions, and other potential influencing factors (if applicable).  

*Ensure that the dataset is placed in the appropriate directory, as indicated in the notebook.*

### 3. **Outputs**
- Plots illustrating historical trends and seasonal components of the time series data.
- Predicted visitor counts for future time periods.
- Metrics comparing the performance of various forecasting models.

## Methodology

The project workflow consists of the following key steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Parsing and formatting date information.
   - Handling missing values and outliers in the dataset.
   - Scaling or transforming data if required for modeling.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualization of trends, seasonality, and irregular components.
   - Stationarity testing using techniques like the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test.

3. **Model Development**
   - Building baseline models such as Na√Øve Forecasting and Moving Average.
   - Developing statistical models like ARIMA and SARIMA for time series forecasting.
   - (Optional) Experimentation with machine learning models for better performance.

4. **Evaluation**
   - Model evaluation using standard time series metrics such as:  
     - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)  
     - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)  
     - Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)  
   - Visual validation of forecasts against actual observations.
